# TalkStake: Multi-Sponsor Integration Platform

## 🎯 Overview

**TalkStake** is a decentralized discussion platform that monetizes expert knowledge through staked conversations. Users stake KDA tokens to join premium discussions, fund speakers with PYUSD superchats, and earn compound yields while accessing high-quality content. All session data is permanently stored on Filecoin for transparency and verification.
